1. **Matrix**
  - [x] 1.1 - Create a `Matrix` class that represents a matrix space
  - [x] 1.2 - Compute the shape of the matrix
  - [x] 1.3 - Compute the determinant of the matrix
  - [x] 1.4 - Code a function that retrives a sub matrix of a matrix
  - [ ] 1.5 - Code the arithmetic operators on the matrices
  - [x] 1.6 - Create a function that multiplies a matrix by 
  - a scalar constant value
  - [ ] 1.7 - Code dot/cross product for a matrix
2. **Systems of Linear Equations**
  - [ ] 2.1 - Create a `System` class that 
represents a systems of equations
  - [ ] 2.2 - Create a `solve` function that 
solves the system of equations
